## DESCRIPTION:
len(a) will give you the number of top-level elements in the list/array named a. Your task is to create a function deepCount that returns the number of ALL elements within an array, including any within inner-level arrays.
```
function deepCount(a){
    let l=a.length
    for(let i=0; i<a.length; i++){
        if(typeof(a[i]) === 'object'){
            l+=deepCount(a[i])
        } 
    }       
    return l
}
